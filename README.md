# IMDB-.list-file-Converter
This program converts the movies.list file from IMDB to a .sql file. Just type in the name of the database, browse to the movies.list file and specify a folder where the .sql file will be saved.

In the options (File -> Options) you can specify the column names of your database. If you do not do that default names will be used.

Just click the Start button after you configured everything. It takes a couple of seconds and about 2 GB RAM because the movies.list file is quite big. Because of that it probably runs only on 64bit systems.
